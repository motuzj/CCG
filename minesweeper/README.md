## Controls

Use arrow keys to move the cursor around the game board. Press `g` to guess and `f` to flag a mine. To see all the available controls, press `?` or `h`.

## Building

### For Unix-based systems

The easiest way to build the game is with `make`. To get started, follow the instructions [here](../README.md#building). Note that while the game has not been tested on macOS, it should work in theory.
