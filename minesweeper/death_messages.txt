You were blown to bits by a minefield.
BOOM! Better luck next time...
You hit a mine... Tip: You can always rm -rf this game.
Segmentation fault: core dumped...and so are you!
Sorry, no amount of grep could help you find that mine.
Looks like you were caught in a fork bomb. Rest in peace, player.
Whoops! That mine was actually a penguin disguised as a bomb. You should've seen it coming!
Segmentation fault: You've just stepped on a mine.
Looks like you forgot to defuse that one mine.
The command 'rm -rf /mines' doesn't work in this game. Better luck next time, champ.
You found a mine, but you forgot the sudo password to defuse it.
Looks like the bomb was more explosive than systemd.
Looks like you found the Linux equivalent of a blue screen of death.
You exploded into a thousand little pieces like a shotgun blast.
Your minesweeper run was shorter than a boot time in Linux.
You found the mine, but not a medkit in time. Too bad!
