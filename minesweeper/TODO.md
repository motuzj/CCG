# TODO list
## Very important!!!
- [ ] make decriptions for functions
- [ ] devide large functions to smaller and seperate them to new file (`board.h`)

## Less important
- [ ] avoid global variables
- [ ] more comments, more, MORE!!!

## Ideas
- [ ] auto-reveal - "if all the mines around a numbered cell have been flagged, clicking on the numbered cell will automatically reveal all the surrounding cells that are not mines"
