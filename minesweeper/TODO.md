# TODO list
## Very important!!!
- [ ] solve weird coordinates problems (width, height, x, y)
- [ ] reveal_empty_cells() not working correctly
- [ ] sometimes the map generation is buggy

## Less important
- [ ] check if commands.c:52 is there useful (marked with TODO comment)
- [ ] help message
- [ ] death messages

## Ideas
- [ ] delete whole command process and make new control system with keys and arrows
- [ ] add colors
- [ ] clear screen after every new draw and show message if there is any
- [ ] include `status` command
